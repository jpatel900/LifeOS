# U3 → live-in-it week: the on-ramp

_The on-ramp for evidence-dependent behavior, not a blanket gate on all downstream engineering. This turns "populate real data" into a concrete, ordered path and names what each step lights up. Grounded in the actual surfaces (verified 2026-07-08, session 9; governance reconciled 2026-07-15). Keep it a brain-dump-and-go, not a planning ritual — the point is to start living in it, not to perfect the data._

## Two prerequisites (both quick)

- **Clear the migration drift** so E1 works in prod — set the `SUPABASE_PROD_MIGRATOR_URL` secret and run Migration Apply (ping me, I'll watch it), or paste `drift-fix-duration-profiles-2026-07-07.sql`. Without it, duration recalibration (E1) can't persist.
- **`OPENAI_API_KEY` is already set** ✓ — so capture-parsing and AI-prose rollups work out of the box.

## The order (each step feeds the next; ~15 min to seed, then just live in it)

1. **Areas + accents** — `Settings → Areas` (or `/areas`). Create your _real_ life areas (job, side project, home, etc.) with their accent colors. **Lights up:** the entire cockpit is area-scoped — nothing else is meaningful until these are real.

2. **Charter per area + your operator profile** — `Settings → Areas`, the two panels. Charter = free text: _what the area is for, its ideal state, season, and constraints._ Operator profile (one global) = _your strengths, weaknesses, and how to compensate._ **Lights up:** both feed the AI context choke point (NS-INV-1) → capture parsing and rollup prose get personalized _immediately_. Empty charters leave the AI prompts byte-identical (no effect), so this is where the assistant starts to feel like it knows you. Highest ratio of effort→payoff.

3. **Brain-dump real thoughts** — `/capture` (or press **C** anywhere). Dump 10–20 real open loops, one per capture. **Lights up:** the AI parser turns each into task/project drafts with a first-move breakdown.

4. **Triage the drafts** — `/triage`. Accept into backlog / someday / reject. **Lights up:** real tasks and projects in real areas.

5. **Plan a real day** — `/calendar`. Accept time-block proposals onto the hour rail; approve the calendar write. **Lights up:** `calendar_blocks` (scheduled) → the Execute focus queue and the Today "Scheduled" count.

6. **Execute for real** — `/execute`. Start focus sessions on your actual blocks; mark outcomes honestly (done / cut-scope / defer). **Lights up:** `execution_sessions` — the _actuals_ that everything learning-related is computed from.

7. **Close the day** — the Close moment (home when it's evening). Log wins (S7), and after a few days approve the weekly rollup (S8, now AI-polished — the new "AI-polished" badge tells you when to scrutinize before approving).

8. **Repeat for ~a week.** The data-dependent surfaces need real cycles to light up:
   - **E1 duration recalibration** — after a few sessions per area, you'll see _"estimated 60m; your actuals run 1.4× → 84m"_ with **Use 84m / Keep 60m**. Accepting retimes the pending block and defaults future ones in that area.
   - **S9 learning loop** — override patterns → policy proposals in Review (E2 makes decided ones stop re-nagging across sessions).
   - **S8 rollups** — weekly per-area highlights/misses, week-over-week, AI-prose (E3).
   - **S7 wins** — the evidence log accrues.

## What "it's working" looks like (the honest enjoyment signal)

By end of week: capture feels faster than a notes app, the plan reflects your real day, recalibration has corrected at least one area's estimates, and a weekly rollup reads back something true you'd forgotten. That is the first honest read on whether LifeOS is worth living in and valid evidence for personalization, policy learning, initiative, and autonomy decisions. Deterministic, owner-ratified foundations that do not depend on this evidence may proceed under ADR 0005.

## Notes

- This is a **brain-dump-and-go**, not a plan-it-perfectly step. Overplanning the seed data is the failure mode — enter roughly-real data fast and let a week of use correct it.
- If any data-entry surface misbehaves as you populate, flag it — that's exactly the kind of real bug the live-in-it week is meant to surface (and the first agent-buildable work that opens up afterward).
